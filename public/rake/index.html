  <h2>The Build Tools</h2>
  <p>
    If you've ever tried to install software from source in the Linux or Unix system, there is a high probability that you have already had contact with <scrong>make</scrong>. Installation process usually looks the same. First you change current directory to that containing uncompressed source code, then you type in following commands:
  </p>
  <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: bash">
    ./configure
    make
    make install</script>
  <p>
    Second and third lines are simply <scrong>make</scrong> program invocations. When launched, <scrong>make</scrong> first looks for the <scrong>Makefile</scrong>. The latter contains information about source files and dependencies between them. <scrong>make</scrong> sorts the dependencies topologically and tries to resolve them in proper order. So it goes like this: first, software developer specifies dependencies and then the build tool is responsible for handling them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Build tools can be used not only for source code compilation, but that was infact the task they were created for. In general, build tools are being used to automate tiresome and repeating tasks.
  </p>
</section>
<section id="rake" class="slide">
  <h2>Rake</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Rake</strong> is a software task management tool. It allows you to specify tasks and describe dependencies as well as to group tasks in a namespace.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is similar to <strong>Make</strong>, but it has a number of differences. The tool is written in the Ruby, and the <strong>Rakefiles</strong> (equivalent of Makefiles in Make) use Ruby syntax. You don't have to learn new complicated build tool syntax.
  </p>
  <div id="install-rake" class="slide">
    <h3>Installation</h3>
    <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: bash">
      gem install rake</script>
  </div>
  <div id="first-rake-task" class="slide">
    <h3>First Rake Task</h3>
    <p>
      Rake tasks should always be located in file named <strong>rakefile</strong>, <strong>Rakefile</strong>, <strong>rakefile.rb</strong> or <strong>Rakefile.rb</strong>. First two forms are most commonly used.
    </p>
    Rakefile
    <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ruby">
      task :default do
        puts "Hello World!"
      end
    </script>
    <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: bash">
      rake
      Hello World!
    </script>
    <p>
      What actually happened? When given Rakefile, Rake is looking for tasks which are simply task method invocations. There may be many tasks located in one Rakefile. When running Rake from the command line, you can pass name of the task that you want to be executed. If there is no task given, Rake is looking for the default task. That is why our Rake invocation did the job without passing any extra parameters.

  <h2>Tasks example</h2>
  <p>Let’s say I wanted to get ready in the morning. My process would be something like this:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Turn off alarm clock</li>
    <li>Groom myself</li>
    <li>Make coffee</li>
    <li>Walk dog</li>
  </ol>
  <p>In rake I might express my morning as follows:</p>
  Rakefile
  <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ruby">
    task :turn_off_alarm do
      puts "Turned off alarm. Would have liked 5 more minutes, though."
    end
   
    task :groom_myself do
      puts "Brushed teeth."
      puts "Showered."
      puts "Shaved."
    end
   
    task :make_coffee do
      puts "Made a cup of coffee. Shakes are gone."
    end
   
    task :walk_dog do
      puts "Dog walked."
    end
  </script>
  <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: bash">
    rake turn_off_alarm
    Turned off alarm. Would have liked 5 more minutes, though.
  </script>
  <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: bash">
    rake groom_myself
    Brushed teeth.
    Showered.
    Shaved.
  </script>
  <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: bash">
    rake make_coffee
    Made a cup of coffee. Shakes are gone.
  </script>
  <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: bash">
    rake walk_dog
    Dog walked.
  </script>
</section><section id="expressing-dependencies" class="slide">
  <h2>Expressing dependencies</h2>
  Rakefile
  <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ruby">
    # ...

    task :ready_for_the_day => [:turn_off_alarm, :groom_myself, :make_coffee, :walk_dog] do
      puts "Ready for the day!"
    end
  </script>
  <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: bash">
    rake ready_for_the_day
    Turned off alarm. Would have liked 5 more minutes, though.
    Brushed teeth.
    Showered.
    Shaved.
    Made a cup of coffee. Shakes are gone.
    Dog walked.
    Ready for the day!
  </script>
  <p>
    By running the <i>ready_for_the_day</i> task it notices that the <i>turn_off_alarm</i>, <i>groom_myself</i>, <i>make_coffee</i>, and <i>walk_dog</i> tasks are all prerequisites of the <i>ready_for_the_day</i> task. Then it runs them all in the appropriate order.
  </p>
  <p>
    Dependencies can be specified not only when defining the task, but also later, depending on the run time conditions.
  </p>
  Rakefile
  <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ruby">
    # ...

    task :ready_for_the_day do
      puts "Ready for the day!"
    end

    task :ready_for_the_day => [:turn_off_alarm, :groom_myself, :make_coffee, :walk_dog]
  </script>
  <p>Effect will be the same.</p>
</section><section id="namespaces" class="slide">
  <h2>Namespaces</h2>
  <p>
    Rake supports the concept of namespaces which essentially lets you group together similar tasks inside of one namespace. You’d then specify the namespace when you call a task inside it. It keeps things tidy while still being quite effective.
  </p>
  Rakefile
  <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ruby">
    namespace :morning do
      task :turn_of_alarm
      # ...
    end
  </script>

  <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: bash">
    rake morning:ready_for_the_day
    ...
  </script>
</section><section id="the-default-task" class="slide">
  <h2>The Default Task</h2>
  <p>
    Rake has the concept of a default task. This is essentially the task that will be run if you type rake without any arguments. If we wanted our default task to be turning off the alarm from the example above, we'd do this:
  </p>
  Rakefile
  <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ruby">
    task :default => 'morning:turn_off_alarm'
    # ...
  </script>
  <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: bash">
    rake
    Turned off alarm. Would have liked 5 more minutes, though.
  </script>
</section><section id="describing-tasks" class="slide">
  <h2>Describing tasks</h2>
  <p>
    You can use the desc method to describe your tasks. This is done on the line right above the task definition. It’s also what gives you that nice output when you run <strong>rake -T</strong> to get a list of tasks. Tasks are displayed in alphabetical order.
  </p>
  Rakefile
  <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ruby">
    desc "Make coffee"
    task :make_coffee do
      puts "Made a cup of coffee. Shakes are gone."
    end
  </script>
  <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: bash">
    rake -T 
    rake morning:make_coffee  # Make coffee
  </script>
</section><section id="redefining-tasks" class="slide">
  <h2>Redefining tasks</h2>
  <p>
    Let’s say you want to add on to an existing task. Perhaps you have another item in your grooming routine like styling your hair. You could write another task and slip it in as a dependency for groom_myself but you could also redefine groom_myself.
  </p>
  Rakefile
  <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ruby">
    namespace :morning do
      task :groom_myself do
        puts "Brushed teeth."
        puts "Showered."
        puts "Shaved."
      end
    end
    
    namespace :morning do
      task :groom_myself do
        puts "Styled hair."
      end
    end
  </script>
  <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: bash">
    rake morning:groom_myself
    Brushed teeth.
    Showered.
    Shaved.
    Styled hair.
  </script>
</section><section id="invoking-tasks" class="slide">
  <h2>Invoking tasks</h2>
  <p>
    You may at some point want to invoke a task from inside another task. Let’s say, for example, you wanted to make coffee in the afternoon, too. If you need an extra upper after lunch you could do that the following way:
  </p>
  Rakefile
  <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ruby">
    namespace :afternoon do
      task :make_coffee do
        Rake::Task['morning:make_coffee'].invoke
        puts "Ready for the rest of the day!"
      end
    end
  </script>
  <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: bash">
    rake afternoon:make_coffee
    Made a cup of coffee. Shakes are gone.
    Ready for the rest of the day!
  </script>
</section><section id="invoking-and-executing" class="slide">
  <h2>Invoking and executing</h2>
  <h3>Invoke</h3>
  <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ruby">
    Rake::Task["morning:make_coffee"].invoke
  </script>
  <p>
    This one executes the dependencies, but it only executes the task if it has not already been invoked.
  </p>
  <h3>Reenable</h3>
  <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ruby">
    Rake::Task["morning:make_coffee"].reenable
    Rake::Task["morning:make_coffee"].invoke
  </script>
  <p>
    This first resets the task's already_invoked state, allowing the task to then be executed again, dependencies and all.
  </p>
  <h3>Execute</h3>
  <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ruby">
    Rake::Task["morning:make_coffee"].execute
  </script>
  <p>
    This always executes the task, but it doesn't execute its dependencies.
  </p>

  <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: bash">

    Made 2 cups of coffee. Shakes are gone.
  </script>
  <p>A few things are happening here that are worth an explanation:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      We are using the ARGV collection of command line arguments to grab the value for our argument. Standard Ruby stuff. Beware though, that this collection will contain all the arguments for Rake, not our task. That’s why we grab the last element in the collection because the first element is the name of our rake task.
    </li>
    <li>
      We have to define a new rake task on the fly with the same name as the value of our argument. If we don’t do this, rake will attempt to invoke a task for each command line argument.
    </li>
